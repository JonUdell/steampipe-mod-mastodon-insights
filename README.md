# Mastodon Insights Mod for Steampipe

View Mastodon timelines, search hashtags, find interesting people, and check server stats.

## Overview

Mastodon dashboards answer questions like:

- Recent direct messages?
- Recent notifications?
- Recent toots on my home timeline?
- On the local timeline?
- On the federated timeline?
- Which toots are hashtagged `science`?
- Which toots on the home timeline match `federation`?
- How many toots, logins, and registrations on my server in recent weeks?
- How many more API calls can I make during this 5-minute cycle?
