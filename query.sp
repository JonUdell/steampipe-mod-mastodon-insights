The duplicate code in the above three queries could be DRYed out using a Postgres function parameterized by table name. But there's
not currently a standard way to deploy a mod that defines and uses functions. If we could alternatively parameterize queries by

/*
Joining with `mastodon_relationship` is possible, and useful -- I want to see at a glance 
if a person I follow has followed me back! -- but not yet practical. The API's `accounts/relationships` 
endpoint takes an array of ids, but the `mastodon_relationship` table for now only takes one id at a time because
you can't make an URL like `accounts/relationships?id[]=1&id[]=2...&id[]=500`. The one-at-a-time approach
is not only slow, but worse, quickly exhausts the 300-API-calls-per-5-minutes limit if you are following
hundreds of people.

TBD: Work out a way to query `mastodon_relationship` with batches of (10? 100?) ids.

Meanwhile, see query.search_people, this approach is practical there if the query yields a small result set.
